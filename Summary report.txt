Summary report:


1. Purpose:
This project aimed to make product data display-friendly on a website. It transformed complex XML data into an organized HTML format. It also ensured that the data followed specific rules set by an XML Schema (XSD).

2. XSLT Stylesheet (transform.xsl):
The XSLT stylesheet acted like a translator, converting XML into HTML. It made product information readable, organizing it nicely for the website.

3. XML Schema Definition (product_schema.xsd):
The XML Schema (XSD) was a rulebook that checked if the data looked right. It ensured that prices were numbers, quantities were valid, and everything matched the intended structure.

4. Python Script:
The Python script combined the transformation and rule-checking steps. It first turned XML into HTML using the stylesheet. Then, it made sure the HTML met the rules defined by the schema.

5. Testing:
Testing covered different scenarios, including mistakes in the data. The solution handled errors gracefully, providing explanations on how to fix issues.

6. Future Ideas:
For the future, we could make the process faster, allow custom styles, and add automated tests. We could also keep track of what happens during the process and update the data in real-time.

7. Conclusion:
The successful project shows how to transform data for display and make sure it's correct. It blends technology skills with practical problem-solving, giving ShopSmart a reliable way to show off their products online while following the rules. This case study highlights how technical solutions can help real-world businesses succeed.
